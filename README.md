Maradona aims to deliver a fast, accurate, and lightweight coach that analyzes all important aspects of a soccer game with 1 camera. 

Maradona works on a multi-modal structure, utilizing a combination of algorithms and ML models to achieve its high performance realtime capabilities. Currently, Maradona has a hybrid in-memory database and a few CV algorithms. We plan on implementing a performance aggregation engine and an advanced IO handler in the near future.
