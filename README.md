## Introduction

Maradona works on a multi-modal structure, utilizing a combination of algorithms and ML models to achieve its high performance realtime capabilities. Currently, Maradona has a hybrid in-memory database and a few CV algorithms. We plan on implementing a performance aggregation engine and an advanced IO handler in the near future. 



## Technical Specifications
- Language: Java 21
- JVM: GraalVM CE 21
  > We're using Graal's compiler and runtime for better performance. OpenJ9 is also a considerable choice. 
- Garbage Collector: G1
  > We're using G1 because of our small heap size and predictable garbage generation. 
- OpenCV:
- TensorFlow:
