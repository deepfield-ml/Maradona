# Maradona Experiments: Rapid Development, Rapid Updates

Here are several experiments and new features we're planning to add to the main branch. The Experiments branch is a rapid-development branch that usually deliver updates within a day or two. Don't expect experiments to be complete or bugproof. Experimental code can be removed if experiments are complete, so check out our other branches for the latest update (or the `main` branch for the most stable update).
